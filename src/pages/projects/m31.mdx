introduction: "Andromeda is a new audio-tactile gaming system that promotes socially inclusive play between visually impaired and sighted individuals.
It expands the non-visual output of existing games, opening up the possibility for people with severe visual impairments to explore digital spaces and experience games."

myRole: "As a web designer and full stack software engineer, I was heavily involved in all aspects of the Andromeda project,
from the initial concept to the final launch. I worked closely with the team to develop the overall aesthetics,
brand identity, and user interface/user experience (UI/UX) design of the product, as well as the engineering of the audio-tactile gaming system."

paragraphs: [ { title: "", images: [ "/assets/m31/gold.webp" ], text: "Andromeda is a truly innovative product that has the potential to make a real difference in the lives of people with disabilities.
I am proud of my work on this project, and I am excited to continue using my skills to create products that make the world a more inclusive place.
In addition to my technical skills, I also brought my creativity and passion for social impact to the Andromeda project."},

text: "The Andromeda App is the central hub for discovering Andromeda-supported games, finding other players,
and learning how to use Controller M31. We chose to develop an app because it is the most accessible and user-friendly
way to communicate the necessary information to our target audience."}, { title: 'Packaging design',
images: [ "/assets/m31/packaging.png", "/assets/m31/package.jpg" ],
text: "We conducted user interviews to gain insights into how to make the packaging for Controller M31 fun,
easy to unbox, and accessible. The packaging features QR codes that link to voiceover walk-throughs,
embossed Braille descriptions, and shapes that indicate where to open the magnetic lid of the box.
Additionally, the packaging is made from recycled paperboard with starch-based adhesive to connect the parts together."}
