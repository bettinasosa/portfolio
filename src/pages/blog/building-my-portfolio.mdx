# Where to find inspiration and gather tools to build a website portfolio

# Introduction

Creativity is like a muscle: the more you use it, the stronger it gets. But what if you're feeling stuck?
How do you get your creative juices flowing again?
My key to unlocking my creativity is to surround myself with inspiration.
I'm constantly looking for new sources of inspiration, from other website portfolios to design blogs to social media.

This is the first post in the series "How to build a website portfolio"

In this post, I'll share my tips on how to find inspiration and gather tools to build a website portfolio that is both visually appealing and professional.

I believe that a website portfolio is one of the most important tools that a web designer or developer can have.
It's a great way to showcase your skills and experience to potential clients and employers.


# Section 1: Finding inspiration

One of the best ways to find inspiration for your website portfolio is to look at other people's work.
There are many great places to find inspiration, such as:

**Other portfolio websites**: This is a great way to see how other web designers and developers have designed their portfolios.
You can also learn from the types of content that they've included, such as project descriptions, case studies, and testimonials.

**Design blogs**: There are many great design blogs that feature articles on web design, typography, and other creative topics.
These blogs talk about latest trends, colour palettes or how to prepare and match your assets.

**Social media**: Social media platforms like Dribbble, Behance, and Pinterest are great places to find inspiration for your website portfolio.
You can browse through the latest designs and follow other creatives for inspiration.

Some of my favourite keywords to use on these platforms are:

Website portfolio
  - Web design
  - UI design
  - UX design
Here are a few specific examples of websites and resources that I find inspiring:

- [David Faure](http://davidfaure.eu/detail/3): David Faure is a French web designer with a beautiful and minimalist portfolio website. I love the way he uses typography and negative space to create a visually appealing and professional design.

- [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/): Awwwards is a website that showcases the best web designs from around the world.

- [Godly](https://godly.website/): Godly is a website that features a collection of the most beautiful and inspiring websites on the internet.

Some of my personal favourites:
- [**Mike Matas**](https://mikematas.com/) is a designer and developer who has worked on projects for Apple, Facebook, and Google. His portfolio website is simple yet elegant, with a focus on typography and negative space.

- [**Bruno Simon**](https://bruno-simon.com/) is a French web designer and developer. His portfolio is a pretty entertaining experience, with a focus on animation and interactivity. He is a web3.js developer.

Here's a tip: Adding all the elements you've gathered to a mood-board (you can easily create one on figma) could be super helpful. This could include color palettes, interactions you'd like to use, certain components, and font styles.
Having all of your inspiration in one place can make it easier to get started and to stay on track with your design.

## Section 2: Tools for gathering inspiration and finding basic assets and icons

## Bonus: Some of the coming design trends

The UI and UX design landscape is constantly evolving, and 2024 is no exception.
Here are a few of the trends that are big right now:

**Personalized experiences**: Users expect to have personalized experiences when interacting with digital interfaces.This means that the UI and UX should be tailored to the individual user's preferences and needs.

**Micro-interactions**: Micro-interactions are small, but important, interactions that users have with digital interfaces.They can be as simple as a button click or a hover animation. Well-designed micro-interactions can make a big difference in the overall user experience.

**Dark mode**: Dark mode is a UI design trend that has been gaining popularity in recent years.It involves using dark colors for the background of an interface, with light - colored text and icons.Dark mode can be easier on the eyes in low - light environments, and it can also help to save battery life on mobile devices.

**Bold and bright colors**: Bold and bright colors are another trend that is expected to be big in 2023.
These colors can be used to create eye - catching and visually appealing interfaces.However, it is important to use bold and bright colors sparingly, as they can be overwhelming if used too heavily.

**Minimalist design**: Minimalist design is a trend that has been gaining popularity in recent years,
and it is expected to continue to be popular in 2024. Minimalist designs are simple, clean, and uncluttered.They focus on the essential elements of a web page and avoid unnecessary distractions.
